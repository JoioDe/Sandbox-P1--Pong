Brainstorming Easter Eggs
- Change the speed of the ball based on the score of the game
- Change the colour of the ball at a specific level/score
- Curved paddle, deflects at different angles
- make the paddle smaller as u get more points
- 360 degrees full rotation for the ball/paddles
- Introduce multiple balls at a specific level/score
- 4way pong
- Unlimited mode, where the ball speeds up over time.
- continuous collision, so the ball can't zip through the paddle?
- Dynamic soundtrack as the score gets higher / ball gets faster
- ball become invisible for a split second-guess
  - Oh yeah, ball becomes invisible halfway across the screen so you have to think about its path
  - i mean u have to guess the path
- pong AI
  - paddle.y =  ball.y
